So we make sure everyone has an equal chance to discover all the amazing things they’re capable of – no matter who they are, where they’re from ,or what looks they like to boss. We exist to give you the confidence to be whomever you want to be.</p>

        <h4>Body positivity</h4>
        <p>It’s super-important for us to promote a healthy body image – we’re not about conforming to any stereotypes – so we work with more than 200 models to represent our audience. And we’re not in the business of digitally altering their appearance either… there’s no reshaping or removing stretch marks here. Our models are part of the ASOS family and we support them by following a Model Welfare Policy.</p>

        <h4>ParalympicsGB partnership</h4>
        <p>We’re more than honoured to be an official partner of the British Paralympic Association, providing the ParalympicsGB team with their formal and ceremonies outfits. Creating a bespoke collection that meets the athletes’ needs, as well as making them look and feel great, is a privilege and has improved our learning about designing adaptive clothing for a range of needs. We can’t wait to continue our work together for the 2020 Tokyo Paralympic Games.</p>
